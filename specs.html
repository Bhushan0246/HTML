<b></b><pre>Sights disable me by birth
Father as witness to.
Mother to teach A to Z every time&#128531
And trying well correcting my sight.
To leave school, after full fill lessons
To change my &#129488disable sight, why?&#128565
For my sight, present friends and other people,
Of book tonic, &#129314medicine plants,
Traditional treatments
And more other onetime roots,
But nothing change my sight,
At last the order coming,
Wear specs.&#129299</pre><br><br>
